# Personalized Region of Interest Recommendation through Adaptive Fusion of Multi-Dimensional User Preferences

This project contains the implementation of the paper „ÄäPersonalized Region of Interest Recommendation through Adaptive Fusion of Multi-Dimensional User Preferences„Äã. It proposes an adaptive weighted recommendation method that fuses spatio-temporal, social, and category preferences to generate personalized ROI (Region of Interest) recommendations.

The proposed method has been evaluated on two real-world datasets‚ÄîFoursquare and Sina Weibo‚Äîand has demonstrated superior performance on multiple recommendation metrics including Recall, F1-score, and NDCG. The model exhibits both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

üìÇ Dataset Description

- Foursquare Dataset

- Sina Weibo Dataset 
  Due to privacy concerns, the Sina Weibo dataset was self-collected and is not publicly available. It is only used for internal research purposes.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Extract user preferences across spatio-temporal, social, and category dimensions
- Adaptively fuse multi-dimensional preferences to generate recommendation results
- Support Top-K ROI recommendation and evaluation using multiple metrics: Recall, F1-score, and NDCG
- Clean, modular code structure with extensive Chinese comments for clarity

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: 
-The code contains many Chinese-language comments. Please translate them into your preferred language as needed.
-Since we understand that there are not many people (especially beginners) in this field who can build upon or learn from this type of codebase, this repository is provided for reference only. It is not perfect, but we hope it may still be helpful to some of you. 

Thank you.
